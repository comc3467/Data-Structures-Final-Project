# Data-Structures-Final-Project
Implementation of Various Linked Lists, Binary Search Trees, and Hash Tables; Compares Efficiency

This final project was a team-project, a collaboration with one classmate of mine, forcing us to not only know the code, but also be able to communicate the findings to each other.

CSCI Compile Data .pdf file is the analysis of how efficient our data structures were at handling the sets of data given. The sets of data were basically large lists of 5-digit numbers, and our analysis proved how certain data structures work more efficiently if there are certain trends within the data, for example, but how there did seem to be a one-size-fits all data structure that worked best for both data sets, regardless of the trends therein.
